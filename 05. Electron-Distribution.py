electrons = int(input())

  
#•	Maximum number of electrons in a shell is distributed with a rule of 2n^2 (n being position of a shell a.k.a. the list index + 1).
#•	For example, maximum number of electrons in 3rd shield is 2*3^2 = 18.
#•	Electrons should fill the lowest level shell first.
#•	If the electrons have completely filled the lowest level shell, the other unoccupied electrons will fill the higher level shell and so on.
